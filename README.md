This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This app is a schedule app where the user can create a calendar on their profile to share their schedule with other people.

The aim of this app is to enable people to know the schedule of other people, and subsequently support scheduling interaction between two or more people.

## Getting Started

This app is still in development progress

First, create a firebase project and input the firebase configuration into the newly created  .env.local file in the root folder.

Then to run, use the command "npm run dev"

Or you can view the app on [MySchedule](https://myschedule-red.vercel.app/)
